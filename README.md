# 🫧 2.5D Pixel Role-Playing Game

- 2.5D game built in Unity using C#, implementing my own illustrations and animations as the in-game assets, and integrating visual shaders, a 3D environment, and narrative elements
- Designed game mechanics and scriptable objects to manage UI overlays and dialogue systems, reinforcing skills in object-orientated design, singleton and observer design patterns, and decomposition

work in progress, check back later!
